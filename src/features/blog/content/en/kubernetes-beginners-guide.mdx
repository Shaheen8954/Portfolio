## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

## Why Use Kubernetes?

- **Automatic Scaling**: Automatically scale your applications up or down based on demand
- **Self-healing**: Automatically restarts containers that fail and replaces them
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes network traffic to ensure stable deployments
- **Storage Orchestration**: Automatically mounts storage systems of your choice
- **Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks**: Update your application with zero downtime

<InfoAlert title="Did You Know?">
  The name "Kubernetes" originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot, and is the root of the words "governor" and "cybernetic".

## Core Components of Kubernetes

### 1. Control Plane Components

#### kube-apiserver
- The front-end of the Kubernetes control plane
- Exposes the Kubernetes API
- Validates and processes API requests

#### etcd
- Consistent and highly-available key-value store
- Stores all cluster data
- The "source of truth" for the cluster

#### kube-scheduler
- Watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node
- Selects a node for them to run on

#### kube-controller-manager
- Runs controller processes
- Includes Node Controller, Replication Controller, Endpoints Controller, and Service Account & Token Controllers

### 2. Node Components

#### kubelet
- An agent that runs on each node in the cluster
- Makes sure containers are running in a Pod

#### kube-proxy
- Maintains network rules on nodes
- Allows network communication to your Pods from network sessions

#### Container Runtime
- The software responsible for running containers
- Common runtimes include containerd, CRI-O, and Docker

## Kubernetes Objects

### Pods
- The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes
- Can contain one or more containers
- Share storage and network resources

### Services
- An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service
- Types: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName

### Deployments
- Provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets
- Describes the desired state for Pods
- Handles scaling and rolling updates

## Getting Started with Kubernetes

1. **Local Development**: Use Minikube or Docker Desktop with Kubernetes
2. **Cloud Providers**: GKE (Google), EKS (AWS), or AKS (Azure)
3. **Managed Services**: DigitalOcean, Linode, or IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service

## Basic Kubernetes Commands

```bash
# Get cluster information
kubectl cluster-info

# Get nodes in the cluster
kubectl get nodes

# Create a deployment
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx

# Expose a deployment as a service
kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
```

## Best Practices

- Use namespaces to organize resources
- Implement resource requests and limits
- Use liveness and readiness probes
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Use Helm for package management
- Implement network policies for security

## Conclusion

Kubernetes is a powerful platform for managing containerized applications. While it has a steep learning curve, understanding its core concepts and components will help you deploy and manage applications more efficiently.
